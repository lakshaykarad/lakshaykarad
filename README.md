## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Lakshay**, a dedicated and curious **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** student with a deep interest in **Android Development, Web Technologies, and Problem Solving**.

My passion lies in transforming ideas into practical applications—whether it's through building Android apps in Java/XML or designing responsive websites using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I'm currently sharpening my skills in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and exploring the backend with **SQL** and **DBMS**.

I believe in continuous learning, building real-world projects, and solving coding problems that challenge my logic and creativity.
